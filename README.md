#Python Project Data Science
This is my capstone project for the course Python Project for Data Science, which is part of the IBM Data Science Certification.
In this project, I analyzed two stocks, being them Tesla's and GameStop's. After gathering data from both yFinance and web scraping, I built a dashboard showing their historical price.
